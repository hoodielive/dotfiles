Xmonad configuration files and options:

Xmonad config file has to be downloaded from haskell.archive, there you'll find xmonad.hs - place in .xmonad/xmonad.hs

Nitrogen/Compton - Wallpaper management. System wallpapers are found at '/usr/share/backgrounds'

Xmobar - the little bar up top. Had to go to github to obtain docs. 

XMonad.Hooks.ManageDocks = so the terminal doesn't hide xmobar

# Polybar
